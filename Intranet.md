What is an intranet?

An Intranet is a private network usually owned by an entreprise.  It is used to share information between a set of approuve people.  Not everyone can access the files shared on an intranet.

For example, a website used by an airline company that is used to deliver updates to the personnel.

An intranet will promote better communication within a company.

Unfortunatly, intranets still face problems such as viruses, worms and other types of malware.
